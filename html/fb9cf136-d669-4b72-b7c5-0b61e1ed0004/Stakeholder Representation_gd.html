		<h1 id="justification">Justification: Why Stakeholder Representation?</h1>
		<p>When developing software it is essential to interact with the stakeholder community. However, it is impossible to directly interact with all of the stakeholders all of the time. This leads to a small number of stakeholders being selected to represent their particular stakeholder communities. For the smooth running of the team it is essential that the people selected have the competency needed to represent their stakeholder communities. The stakeholder representation competency encapsulates the abilities needed to be able to represent and act on behalf of others within a software engineering endeavor.</p>
