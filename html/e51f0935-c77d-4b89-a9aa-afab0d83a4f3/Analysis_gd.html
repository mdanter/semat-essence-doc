		<h1 id="justification">Justification: Why Analysis?</h1>
		<p>Analysis is an examination of a system including its environment, its elements, and their relations. It is performed in order to gather, manage and analyze large and complex amounts of information and data and make sense of it. It is more than just the separation of a whole into its component parts as it involves the resolution of complex expressions into simpler or more basic ones, and the clarification of the purpose of a system by an explanation of its use.</p>
		<p>When developing software it is essential that the current situation is analyzed and the correct requirements identified for the new system. The requirements themselves must also be analyzed to make sure that they are, amongst other things, practical, achievable and appropriately sized to drive the systemâ€™s development. The analysis competency encapsulates the abilities needed to successfully define the system to be built.</p>
