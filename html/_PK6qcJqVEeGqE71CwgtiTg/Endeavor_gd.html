		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p id="brief">This area of concern contains everything to do with the team, and the way that they approach their work.</p>
		<p>Software engineering is a significant endeavor that typically takes many weeks to complete, affects many different people (the stakeholders) and involves a development team (rather than a single developer). Any practical method must describe a set of practices to effectively plan, lead and monitor the efforts of the team.</p>
		<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
		<p>In each area of concern there are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Essential things to work with – descriptions of the kind of things that the team will produce, and use in the process of developing good software</li>
			<li>Essential things to do – descriptions of the challenges the team faces and the activities that the team will perform to meet them</li>
			<li>Essential competencies &#8211; descriptions of the skills that the team require to be able to carry out the activities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="workwith">Things to Work With</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>endeavor</strong> area of concern the team and its way-of-working have to be formed, and the work has to be done:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_e62xAJs4EeGz7PwLWcYeYg/Work_gd.html">Work</a>: Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result. In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements, and addressing the opportunity, presented by the customer. The work is guided by the practices that make up the team’s way-of-working.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_IuWcIJtEEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Team_gd.html">Team</a>: The group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery and support of a specific software system. The team plans and performs the work needed to update and change the software system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_fv9NAJs4EeGz7PwLWcYeYg/Way of Working_gd.html">Way of Working</a>: The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work. The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="todo">Things to Do</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>endeavor</strong> area of concern the team has to be formed and progress the work in-line with the agreed way-of-working:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_62RugJtCEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Prepare to do the Work_gd.html">Prepare to do the Work</a>: Set up the team and its working environment. Understand and commit to completing the work.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_AstWYJtDEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Coordinate Activity_gd.html">Coordinate Activity</a>: Co-ordinate and direct the team’s work. This includes all on-going planning and re-planning of the work, and adding any additional resources needed to complete the formation of the team.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_Fjdp8JtDEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Support the Team_gd.html">Support the Team</a>: Help the team members to help themselves, collaborate and improve their way of working.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_KzsNcJtDEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Track Progress_gd.html">Track Progress</a>: Measure and assess the progress made by the team.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_QKyN8JtDEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Stop the Work_gd.html">Stop the Work</a>: Shut-down the software engineering endeavor and the handover of the team’s responsibilities.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="comp">Competencies</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>endeavor</strong> area of concern the team has to be able to organize itself and manage its work load. This requires the following competencies to be available to the team:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../cff34f1b-cc2d-499f-9806-842649feca07/Leadership_gd.html">Leadership</a>: This competency enables a person to inspire and motivate a group of people to achieve a successful conclusion to their work and to meet their objectives.
