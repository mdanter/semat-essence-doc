					<p>The Essence Kernel is a stripped-down, light-weight set of definitions that captures the essence of effective, scalable software engineering in a practice independent way.</p>
					<p id="brief">The focus of the kernel is to define a common basis for the definition of software development practices, one that allows them to be defined and applied independently. The practices can then be mixed and matched to create specific software engineering methods tailored to the specific needs of a specific software engineering community, project, team or organization.</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p id="purposes">The kernel has many benefits including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It allows you to apply as few or as many practices as you like.</li>
						<li>It allows you to easily capture your current practices in a reusable and extendable way.</li>
						<li>It allows you to evaluate your current practices against a technique neutral control framework.</li>
						<li>It allows you to align and compare your on-going work and methods to a common, technique neutral framework, and then to complement it with any missing critical practices or process elements.</li>
						<li>It allows you to start with a minimal method adding practices as the endeavor progresses and when you need them.</li>
					</ul>
