		<h1 id="preamble"></h1>
		<p>The Essence Kernel is a stripped-down, light-weight set of definitions that captures the essence of effective, scalable software engineering in a practice independent way.</p>
		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p id="brief">The focus of the kernel is to define a common basis for the definition of software development practices, one that allows them to be defined and applied independently. The practices can then be mixed and matched to create specific software engineering methods tailored to the specific needs of a specific software engineering community, project, team or organization.</p>
		<p id="purposes">The kernel has many benefits including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It allows you to apply as few or as many practices as you like.</li>
			<li>It allows you to easily capture your current practices in a reusable and extendable way.</li>
			<li>It allows you to evaluate your current practices against a technique neutral control framework.</li>
			<li>It allows you to align and compare your on-going work and methods to a common, technique neutral framework, and then to complement it with any missing critical practices or process elements.</li>
			<li>It allows you to start with a minimal method adding practices as the endeavor progresses and when you need them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="WhatsintheKernel">What’s in the Kernel?</h1>
		<p id="content">The kernel is described using a small subset of the Kernel Language. It is organized into three areas of concern, each containing a small number of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Alphas</b> – representations of the essential things to work with. The Alphas provide descriptions of the kind of things that a team will manage, produce, and use in the process of developing, maintaining and supporting good software. They also act as the anchor for any additional sub-alphas and work products required by the software engineering practices.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Activity Spaces</b> - representations of the essential things to do. The Activity Spaces provide descriptions of the challenges a team faces when developing, maintaining and supporting software systems, and the kinds of things that the team will do to meet them.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Competencies</b> - representations of the essential competencies required by software engineering practices.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To maintain its practice independence the kernel does not include any instances of the other language elements such as work products or activities. These only make sense within the context of a specific practice.</p>
		<p>The best way to get an overview of the kernel as a whole is to look at the full set of Alphas and Activity Spaces and how they are related.</p>
		<h2 id="OrganizingtheKernel">Organizing the Kernel</h2>
		<p id="organizing">The Kernel is organized into three discrete areas of concern, each focusing on a specific aspect of software engineering. As shown in the figure below, these are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_HmSbYJqVEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Customer_gd.html">Customer</a> – This area of concern contains everything to do with the actual use and exploitation of the software system to be produced.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_OJ55YJqVEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Solution_gd.html">Solution</a> – This area of concern contains everything to do the specification and development of the software system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_PK6qcJqVEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Endeavor_gd.html">Endeavor</a> – This area of concern contains everything to do with the team, and the way that they approach their work.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../images/kernel_areas.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Throughout the diagrams in the body of the kernel specification, the three areas of concern are distinguished with different color codes where green stands for customer, yellow for solution, and blue for endeavor. The colors will facilitate the understanding and tracking of which area of concern owns which Alphas and Activity Spaces.</p>
		<h2 id="AlphasTheThingstoWorkWith">Alphas: The Things to Work With</h2>
		<p id="thingstoworkwith">The kernel Alphas 1) capture the key concepts involved in software engineering, 2) allow the progress and health of any software engineering endeavor to be tracked and assessed, and 3) provide the common ground for the definition of software engineering methods and practices. The Alphas, their relationships and their owning areas of concern are shown in the following figure:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../images/things_to_work_with.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>customer</strong> area of concern the team needs to understand the stakeholders and the opportunity to be addressed:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_thrioJqXEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Opportunity_gd.html">Opportunity</a>: The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system. The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team’s shared understanding of the stakeholders’ needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing justification for its development.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_Kde1gJqWEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Stakeholders_gd.html">Stakeholders</a>: The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system. The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. They must be involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>solution</strong> area of concern the team needs to establish a shared understanding of the requirements, and implement, build, test, deploy and support a software system that fulfills them:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_f9EMcJqqEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Requirements_gd.html">Requirements</a>: What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders. It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the new system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_hIYJAJqqEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Software System_gd.html">Software System</a>: A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software. The primary product of any software engineering endeavor, a software system can be part of a larger software, hardware or business solution.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>endeavor</strong> area of concern the team and its way-of-working have to be formed, and the work has to be done:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_e62xAJs4EeGz7PwLWcYeYg/Work_gd.html">Work</a>: Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result. In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements, and addressing the opportunity, presented by the customer. The work is guided by the practices that make up the team’s way-of-working.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_IuWcIJtEEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Team_gd.html">Team</a>: The group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery and support of a specific software system. The team plans and performs the work needed to update and change the software system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_fv9NAJs4EeGz7PwLWcYeYg/Way of Working_gd.html">Way of Working</a>: The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work. The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="ActivitySpacesTheThingstoDo">Activity Spaces: The Things to Do</h2>
		<p id="thingstodo">The kernel also provides a set of activity spaces that complement the Alphas to provide an activity based view of software engineering.</p>

			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="CompetenciesTheAbilitiesNeeded">Competencies: The Abilities Needed</h2>
		<p>The kernel also provides a set of competencies that complement the Alphas and Activity Spaces to provide a view of the key competencies needed to do software engineering. </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../images/kernel_competencies.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>customer</strong> area of concern the team has to be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the business and technical aspects of their chosen domain and have the ability to accurately reflect the views of their stakeholders. This requires the following competencies to be available to the team:
		</p>
