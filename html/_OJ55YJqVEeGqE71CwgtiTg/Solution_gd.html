		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p id="brief">This area of concern covers everything to do with the specification and development of the software system.</p>
		<p>The goal of software engineering is to develop working software as part of the solution to some problem. Any method adopted must describe a set of practices to help the team produce good quality software in a productive and collaborative fashion.</p>
		<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
		<p>In each area of concern there are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Essential things to work with – descriptions of the kind of things that the team will produce, and use in the process of developing good software</li>
			<li>Essential things to do – descriptions of the challenges the team faces and the activities that the team will perform to meet them</li>
			<li>Essential competencies &#8211; descriptions of the skills that the team require to be able to carry out the activities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="workwith">Things to Work With</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>solution</strong> area of concern the team needs to establish a shared understanding of the requirements, and implement, build, test, deploy and support a software system that fulfills them:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_f9EMcJqqEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Requirements_gd.html">Requirements</a>: What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders. It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the new system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_hIYJAJqqEeGqE71CwgtiTg/Software System_gd.html">Software System</a>: A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software. The primary product of any software engineering endeavor, a software system can be part of a larger software, hardware or business solution.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="todo">Things to Do</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>solution</strong> area of concern the team has to develop an appropriate solution to exploit the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../_3zG5cJs3EeGz7PwLWcYeYg/Understand the Requirements_gd.html">Understand the Requirements</a>: Establish a shared understanding of what the system to be produced must do.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_RW05YJs6EeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Shape the System_gd.html">Shape the System</a>: Shape the system so that it is easy to develop, change and maintain, and can cope with current and expected future demands. This includes the overall design and architecting of the system to be produced.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_udE20Js6EeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Implement the System_gd.html">Implement the System</a>: Build a system by implementing, testing and integrating one or more system elements. This includes bug fixing and unit testing
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_PUctwJtBEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Test the System_gd.html">Test the System</a>: Verify that the system produced meets the stakeholders’ requirements.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_6coU4JtBEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Deploy the System_gd.html">Deploy the System</a>: Take the tested system and make it available for use outside the development team.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../_QHuIUJtCEeGD_KwXqdXFgA/Operate the System_gd.html">Operate the System</a>: Support the use of the software system in the live environment.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="comp">Competencies</h1>
		<p>In the 
			<strong>solution</strong> area of concern the team has to be able to capture and analyze the requirements, and build and operate a software system that fulfils them. This requires the following competencies to be available to the team:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="../e51f0935-c77d-4b89-a9aa-afab0d83a4f3/Analysis_gd.html">Analysis</a>: This competency encapsulates the ability to understand opportunities and their related stakeholder needs, and transform them into an agreed and consistent set of requirements.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../265e7c5b-5cdb-4dbf-846b-e2d45278b785/Development_gd.html">Development</a>: This competency encapsulates the ability to design and program effective software systems following the standards and norms agreed by the team.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="../835bbd82-6867-48a4-8186-86fc839afd17/Testing_gd.html">Testing</a>: This competency encapsulates the ability to test a system, verifying that it is usable and that it meets the requirements.
			</li>
		</ul>
